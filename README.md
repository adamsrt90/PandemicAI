Creating an AI to play the board game, Pandemic

The idea is to create a "text playable" version of the game to allow an AI to train on the game. The hope is to have several AIs trained for different play styles.
Maybe an AI that is trained for curing diseases or managing outbreaks;
An AI that is geared towards curing as fast as possible; and
An general AI that will adjust accordinglying to the board's states. 

The game saves its "state" after each turn that will be fed to the AI on its turn for it to make a decision about it's next four moves.
